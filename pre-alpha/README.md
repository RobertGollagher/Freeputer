## Pre-alpha

This pre-alpha folder contains software which is not yet ready for alpha release. Such pre-alpha software is inherently experimental in nature, is likely to greatly change before alpha release or to never make it to alpha release, and may well be incomplete, unstable and unreliable. That is, it is considered to be suitable only for experimentation and nothing more. In other words, this folder is for work in progress prior to reaching a stage suitable for alpha release.
