The tape is a textual user interface (TUI) as described in tape/README.md.

This implementation:

  * is for 5-Volt Arduino boards (e.g. Uno or Mega 2560),
    used as a physical tape terminal with keyboard and display,
    using serial communication to connect to a tape server (such as
    an FVM running 'ts.fl' on another Arduino or on a Linux computer)
  * uses a PS/2 keyboard via the PS2KeyAdvanced and PS2KeyMap libraries
  * uses a character LCD display (abbreviated here as CLCD hence 'tape-clcd.ino')
    which has 40x4 columns x rows with a HD44780-compatible interface with
    two enable lines (Winstar WH4004A-YYH-JT LCD display module) and therefore
    requires the LiquidCrystalFast library (from www.pjrc.com) rather
    than the ordinary Arduino LiquidCrystal library
  * or can use smaller CLCDs (such as 16x2 or 20x4) in SINGLE_ENABLE_PIN mode
    and this uses the ordinary Arduino LiquidCrystal library
  * supports 7-bit ASCII display only (not proper UTF-8 display)
  * supports multiplexing (an optional feature of FVM 1.1)
  * supports split-tape tracing (stdtrc display in second half of tape)

WARNING: When running a 40x4 CLCD on an Arduino Mega 2560 and it is
in MULTIPLEX mode, it is necessary to use TAPE_VERY_SLOW_BAUD otherwise
unfortunately such a slow tape terminal cannot handle multiplexing at all.
It is better to simply not use MULTIPLEX and not use TAPE_SPLIT_TRC
when running this sketch on such slow hardware, since even such
slow hardware works very well when not in MULTIPLEX mode.

To build use the Arduino IDE 1.6.7 or higher.

To connect to a physical Freeputer instance (such as on another Arduino)
simply connect the RX pin of this tape terminal board to the TX pin of the
tape server board and vice versa; to do this you must use a logic level
converter if the boards do not both run at the same voltage. You must
also connect a GND pin of one board to a GND pin of the other board
so that the boards share a common ground. Disconnect all of these
connections when programming the boards using the Arduino IDE.

Note: to create such a physical Freeputer tape server instance on another Arduino
you would use 'fvm.c' for FVM 1.1 (see instructions therein) and build that
using the Arduino IDE. You would of course first use the 'romMake.sh' script
to compile the 'ts.fl' Freelang program into a 'rom.h' header file
that would then be incorporated into the FVM executable built
by the Arduino IDE (see 'fvm.c', 'romMake.sh', 'ts.fl'). 

To connect to a virtual Freeputer instance (such as on a Linux computer)
simply use the serial connection built into the USB cable of your Arduino board
in the normal manner. For example, this might be recognized by Linux as serial
device /dev/ttyACM0. However, you must first ensure that Linux knows the
configuration of the serial device. That can be achieved either by
connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 at least once with the serial monitor in the
Arduino IDE set to 115200 baud or by briefly connecting at least
once with minicom thus:

  minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -c on -b 115200

Then in Linux you can connect your FVM instance to the tape terminal by:

  ./fvm < /dev/ttyACM0 > /dev/ttyACM0

For the tape to behave meaningfully, there must be an application running
on the (physical or virtual) FVM instance and that application must be written
to control a tape. A simple example of such a Freeputer application is
the Freelang program 'ts.fl' (short for Tape Server) which selectively and
appropriately echos characters typed into the tape so
that they appear on the tape while respecting escape sequences
(which for a tape, unlike an ANSI terminal, begin with the DLE character
not the ESC character). Actually the application controlling the tape
via the aforementioned device does not necessary have to be a Freeputer
application; it could be any kind of application that appropriately
handles its stdin and stdout streams so as to control a tape.

This 'tape-clcd.ino' implementation of the tape happens to communicate via
serial connection and accepts keyboard input; therefore it can be properly
described as a 'tape terminal'. A tape does not necessarily have to use
serial communication and does not necessarily have to accept input
(some tapes might be only for display not input). However, the most
common kind of tape implementation is a tape terminal since such
an implementation has many uses and favours modular rather than
monolithic system design (rather than building a display
into a standalone Freeputer instance).

Since this implementation uses a rectangular screen,
the tape is wrapped into a 2D geometry and therefore this
implementation tracks things such as row and column. It is important to
remember that the tape itself has no concept of multi-dimensional geometry,
it is just a sequence of cells. All matters of geometry are private to
and internal to an implementation and have nothing to do with the
logical nature of the tape.

You will also note there is an option to use multiplexing.
In this context, multiplexing refers to a new optional feature in some
FVM 1.1 implementations that uses a simple multiplexing scheme to allow
a single physical serial connection to be used to support not only
the Freeputer stdin and stdout streams but also stdtrc (the Freeputer
output stream on which tracing output can be sent from an FVM instance
as an aid to debugging a Freeputer application). In this simple
multiplexing scheme each data byte is preceded by a byte identifying
the stream to which that data byte belongs. This 'tape-clcd.ino' supports
that multiplexing and indeed you must have it enabled if you wish to see
stdtrc output in the second half of the tape when running in
split-tape mode (entered by pressing Ctrl-T) unless you wish instead to
use a second physical serial connection for stdtrc (see TAPE_STDTRC_SEP).

If the tape appears to be unresponsive and displays an exclamation mark
this means an error has occurred; this will occur if you leave MULTIPLEX
defined yet the FVM you are connected to is not using multiplexing,
or if for any other reason the tape is sent garbage input that
cannot be meaningfully decoded.

If implementing your own tape on some other platform, it is important
to understand that the fields of the tape struct in this 'tape-clcd.ino'
are particular to this implementation. The only fields of that
struct that belong to the logical nature of a tape are pos
(the current cell), maxPos (the length of the tape),
and arguably maybe some of the mode information.

Important: stdtrc output generally does not support UTF-8.
Only send 7-bit ASCII characters to stdtrc. Furthermore, this 'tape-clcd.ino'
does not support the proper display of UTF-8 characters anywhere on the
tape; at best they will be displayed as unknown-character symbols.

==============================================================================

CHARACTER DISPLAY: since this tape uses a monochrome display device, it is
sometimes impossible to tell the difference between certain special characters
(e.g. CR, LF, HT) which are all displayed as the same character (e.g. '*')
but which would, on a colour device, be differentiated by colour.
This means, for example, that you cannot tell the difference between
a real exclamation mark and one that indicates the approximate location
of corrupt data in the stream being displayed. This problem may be
solved in future by the use of custom characters but for now
this is a known issue with this monochrome tape.

==============================================================================

  For reference: FVM 1.1 SIMPLE MULTIPLEXING

  FVM 1.1 may optionally use multiplexing to allow multiple virtual devices
  to share a single physical serial communication link. The simple multiplexing
  is that each data packet is preceded by a routing byte in which the
  most significant bit (bit 7) is always zero, the next two
  most significant bits (bits 6 and 5) identify the device type and
  the next bit (bit 4) identifies the packet size (essentially byte or word) and
  the four least significant bits (bit 3 to 0) identify the absolute value
  of the device ID (e.g. an ID of -1 is communicated as an ID of 1).
  Note that, by Freeputer convention, a device ID of 0 is only used for stdtrc
  and stdblk; an input stream never has a device ID of 0; and output streams
  have negative IDs. The crude multiplexing scheme used here only supports
  device IDs whose absolute value is between 0 and 15 inclusive.

  Most significant bits:

    0b0100 = device: output stream, packet size: 1 byte (byte)
    0b0101 = device: output stream, packet size: 4 bytes (word)
    0b0000 = device: input stream, packet size: 1 byte (byte)
    0b0001 = device: input stream, packet size: 4 bytes (word)
    0b0010 = device: block device, packet size: 5 bytes (word addr then byte)
    0b0011 = device: block device, packet size: 8 bytes (word addr then word)
    0b0110 = reserved (not used)
    0b0111 = reserved (not used) e.g. 0b01111111 unknown device
    0b1--- = reserved (not used)

  Thus byte communication uses:

    0b01000000 = stdtrc 0
    0b00000001 = stdin 1
    0b00000002 = stdimp 2
    0b00100000 = stdblk 0
    0b01000001 = stdout -1
    0b01000010 = stdexp -2
    0b0110----- = reserved (not used)

  Thus word communication uses:

    0b01010000 = stdtrc 0
    0b00010001 = stdin 1
    0b00010002 = stdimp 2
    0b00110000 = stdblk 0
    0b01010001 = stdout -1
    0b01010010 = stdexp -2
    0b0111----- = reserved (not used)

  This handleOver function should be called when not in wrap mode and
  output has reached the end of the tape (not including the message cell
  and not including, if in split-tape mode, the second half of the
  tape which is used for stdtrc output). This handleOver function
  displays a message (by calling msgOver()) so the user knows
  overflow occurred and it also informs the server that overflow
  occurred by sending CHAR_EM to the server). The aim of this
  is to inform both the user and the server that some
  information the server wanted the user to see was
  not seen because the tape was full. What happens next is up to the
  server (it might keep sending characters anyway, knowing they
  will not be visible, or it might stop sending characters,
  or it might reposition the cursor, or command the tape to clear,
  or whatever is the appropriate behaviour for the application).

  In short: when in wrap mode, previous output is simply overwritten
  as the tape automatically would clear itself and keep displaying
  characters received (thus handleOver should never be called in wrap mode).
  That means the most recent output is always visible but earlier
  output might be overwriten. Whereas when not in wrap mode,
  earlier output is visible and more recent output is not visible
  once the tape becomes full (unless the server decides to make
  something else happen when handleOver is called and it subsequently
  receives CHAR_EM as notification). Note that EM is End of Medium.
