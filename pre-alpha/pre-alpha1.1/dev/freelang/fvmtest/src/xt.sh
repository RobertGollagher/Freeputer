# =====
# 
# A script to conveniently generate subsets of the 'fvmtest.fl' test suite
# for running on FVM Lite one at a time. This is needed because FVM Lite,
# unlike FVM Heavy, does not have enough ROM to run the whole fvmtest
# test suite at once. See 'fvmtest.fl' for details of the suite.

# 
# Instructions
# ============
#
# In the same directory as a copy of 'fvmtest.fl',
# run this 'xt.sh' bash script by:
#
#   ./xt.sh
#
# It generates numbered Freelang source files, each one representing
# one subset of the fvmtest test suite. It does this by using the special
# comments already extant in 'fvmtest.fl' which demarkate subsets of
# sizes suitable for running on FVM Lite. For example it generates
# '1-fvmtest.fl' which represents the first subset of the test suite.
# You can then compile an FVM instance incorporating that subset by:
#
#   ./romMake.sh 1-fvmtest.fl && make
#
# And then you can run that subset of the test suite, once suitably
# colocated with the necessary files (as detailed in 'fvmtest.fl'),
# in the usual manner by:
#
#   ./fvmtest.sh
#
