# Instructions
# ============
#
# Running this script compiles a Freeputer program from the specified
# source file into binary 'rom.fp' and creates a C header file 'rom.h'
# which represents that binary program as a char array. The purpose of doing
# so is so that subequently you can include the compiled program
# into an FVM executable as described in 'fvm.m4'.
#
# Example:
#
#   ./romMake.sh source.fl
#
# Produces:
#
#   rom.fp
#   rom.h
#
