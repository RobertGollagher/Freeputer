==============================================================================

A sender for receiver.c.

This program sends a text file one byte at a time to stdout,
using very simple software flow control.

Build using:

  gcc sender.c -o sender

Behavour is:
  (1) wait for ACK from stdin;
  (2) send 1 byte of text to stdout;
  (3) repeat (1) and (2) until whole text sent;
  (4) send EOT;
  (5) quit.

The following instructions assume:
  - the text to be sent by the sender is in 'textfile'
  - the text received by the receiver shall be stored to 'received'
  - optionally, logging of ACKs by tee shall be stored to 'acklog'

For debugging, this can be run with logging of ACKs using:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | tee acklog | ./sender textfile > mypipe

Normally just do:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | ./sender textfile > mypipe

  if (!text) {
    printf("File not found: %s\n", argv[1]);
    return 1;
  }

  // To ease debugging here is a second log (other than: tee acklog)
  // which contains all characters (not just ACKs) received from receiver
  FILE *login = fopen("log.in", "w");
  if (!login) {
    printf("Could not open log.in for writing");
    return 1;
  }

  // To ease debugging here is a third log (other than: tee acklog)
  // which contains all characters sent to the receiver

// FIXME A hack: instead of quitting, just keep logging everything
// returned from the receiver. This is not needed when communicating with
// receiver.c but is helpful for testing self-hosted compiling of flc
// on Raspberry Pi bare metal. Said testing was successful.
// This now never exits, so use Ctrl-C to kill it.
