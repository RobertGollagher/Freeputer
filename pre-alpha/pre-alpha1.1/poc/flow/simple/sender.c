==============================================================================

A sender for receiver.c.

This program sends a text file one byte at a time to stdout,
using very simple software flow control.

Build using:

  gcc sender.c -o sender

Behavour is:
  (1) wait for ACK from stdin;
  (2) send 1 byte of text to stdout;
  (3) repeat (1) and (2) until whole text sent;
  (4) send EOT;
  (5) quit.

The following instructions assume:
  - the text to be sent by the sender is in 'textfile'
  - the text received by the receiver shall be stored to 'received'
  - optionally, logging of ACKs by tee shall be stored to 'acklog'

For debugging, this can be run with logging of ACKs using:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | tee acklog | ./sender textfile > mypipe

Normally just do:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | ./sender textfile > mypipe

  if (!text) {
    printf("File not found: %s\n", argv[1]);
    return 1;
  }

  while (1) {
    while(getchar() != CHAR_ACK){};
    // Go ahead and send a byte of text
    char c = fgetc(text);
    if (!feof(text)) {
      putchar(c);

    } else {

      fflush(stdout);
      break;
