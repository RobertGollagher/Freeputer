==============================================================================

A receiver for sender.c.

This program receives a text file one byte at a time from stdin,
using very simple software flow control.

This is a proof of concept. Since it has succeeded on Linux, the next step is
that this same behaviour will be tried in the I/O implementation of the
bare-metal FVM for U-Boot (targeting Raspberry Pi) in 'fvm.c'.

Build using:

  gcc receiver.c -o receiver

Behavour is:
  (1) send ACK to stdout;
  (2) receive 1 byte only;
  (3) repeat until EOT is received;
  (4) quit.

The following instructions assume:
  - the text to be sent by the sender is in 'textfile'
  - the text received by the receiver shall be stored to 'received'
  - optionally, logging of ACKs by tee shall be stored to 'acklog'

For debugging, this can be run with logging of ACKs using:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | tee acklog | ./sender textfile > mypipe

Normally just do:

  mkfifo mypipe
  ./receiver received < mypipe | ./sender textfile > mypipe

  }

  FILE *outfile = fopen(argv[1], "w");
  if (!outfile) {
    printf("File could not be used for output: %s\n", argv[1]);
    return 1;
  }

  while (1) {
    // Let the sender know we are ready to receive a byte
    putchar(CHAR_ACK);
    fflush(stdout);
    // Wait for a byte from the sender
    char c = getchar();
    if (c != CHAR_EOT) {
      fputc(c, outfile);
      fflush(outfile);
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }

  fclose(outfile);
  return 0;
