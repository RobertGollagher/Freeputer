==============================================================================

The tape is a textual user interface (TUI) as described in tape/README.md.

This implementation:

  * uses ncurses
  * is not portable, runs on Linux only
  * uses Linux system calls such as poll, open, close
  * supports physical serial devices (such as from an FVM on Arduino or chipKIT)
  * supports pseudo terminals (to connect to a local FVM instance on Linux)
  * supports UTF-8 display (if run within a UTF-8 terminal emulator)
  * supports multiplexing (an optional feature of FVM 1.1)
  * supports split-tape tracing (stdtrc display in second half of tape)

On Debian you will need these libraries installed:

  aptitude install libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev

To build use:

  gcc -o tape tape.c -lncursesw

To connect to a locally running Freeputer instance, assuming that
socat reports it has created /dev/pts/0 and that your FVM executable
is located in the current directory and called fvm:

  socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 "exec:./fvm ...,pty,raw,echo=0"

  ./tape /dev/pts/0

To connect to a physical Freeputer instance (such as on Arduino or chipKIT)
attached to physical serial device such as /dev/ttyUSB0 you must first ensure
that Linux knows the configuration of the serial device. That can be achieved
either by connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0 at least once with the serial monitor
in the Arduino IDE set to 115200 baud or by briefly connecting at least
once with minicom thus:

  minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -c on -b 115200

Thereafter you can simply do:

  ./tape /dev/ttyUSB0

For the tape to behave meaningfully, there must be an application running
on the FVM instance which the aforementioned device (such as /dev/pts/0 or
/dev/ttyUSB0) is connected to, and that application must be written
to control a tape. A simple example of such a Freeputer application is
the Freelang program 'ts.fl' (short for Tape Server) which selectively and
appropriately echos characters typed (or pasted) into the tape so
that they appear on the tape while respecting escape sequences
(which for a tape, unlike an ANSI terminal, begin with the DLE character
not the ESC character). Actually the application controlling the tape
via the aforementioned device does not necessary have to be a Freeputer
application; it could be any kind of application that appropriately
handles its stdin and stdout streams so as to control a tape.

This 'tape.c' implementation of the tape happens to communicate via
a serial device and accepts keyboard input; therefore it can be properly
described as a 'tape terminal'. A tape does not necessarily have to use
serial communication and does not necessarily have to accept input
(some tapes might be only for display not input). However, the most
common kind of tape implementation is a tape terminal since such
an implementation has many uses and favours modular rather than
monolithic system design (rather than building a display
into a standalone Freeputer instance).

Since this implementation uses ncurses and runs within an ANSI terminal
emulator, the tape is wrapped into a 2D geometry and therefore this
implementation tracks things such as row and column. It is important to
remember that the tape itself has no concept of multi-dimensional geometry,
it is just a sequence of cells. All matters of geometry are private to
and internal to an implementation and have nothing to do with the
logical nature of the tape. On a practical note: you should not resize
the terminal emulator window within which the tape is running while
the tape is running. Only resize the terminal emulator window
prior to starting the tape within it; with that proviso you can
run the tape in almost any size of terminal emulator window,
from the very small (say 16x1) to huge (full screen).

In the code comments below you will see the word 'server' being used.
This simply refers to the application (typically but not necessarily a
Freeputer application, such as the tape server 'ts.fl') controlling the tape
via the serial device. You will note that 'tape.c' has to keep track
of which characters are coming from local keyboard input and which
characters are coming from the server; both arrive via poll. It is worth
noting that a 'tape terminal' implementation on bare metal (such as an Arduino
wired up to a PS/2 keyboard and an alphanumeric LCD display) is actually
much simpler than this Linux implementation because such complexities
as poll (and, indeed, ncurses) are then not needed. It is often the
case that using bare metal is simpler and easier for simple tasks
than using complex operating systems such as Linux.

Furthermore you will note there is an option to use multiplexing.
In this context, multiplexing refers to a new optional feature in some
FVM 1.1 implementations that uses a simple multiplexing scheme to allow
a single physical serial connection to be used to support not only
the Freeputer stdin and stdout streams but also stdtrc (the Freeputer
output stream on which tracing output can be sent from an FVM instance
as an aid to debugging a Freeputer application). In this simple
multiplexing scheme each data byte is preceded by a byte identifying
the stream to which that data byte belongs. This 'tape.c' supports that
multiplexing and indeed you must have it enabled if you wish to see
stdtrc output in the second half of the tape when running in
split-tape mode (entered by pressing Ctrl-U). Since such multiplexing is
a new feature coming in FVM 1.1, you should ensrue MULTIPLEX is undefined
here in 'tape.c' for now; unfortunately this means you will never see
any stdtrc output in split-tape mode. Note that the purpose of the new
multiplexing scheme (the use of which is entirely optional) is to make it
easier to run Freeputer applications on Arduino and other development boards
without requiring multiple physical serial connections.

If the tape appears to be unresponsive and displays a red exclamation mark
this means an error has occurred; this will occur if you leave MULTIPLEX
defined yet the FVM you are connected to is not using multiplexing,
or if for any other reason the tape is sent garbage input that
cannot be meaningfully decoded.

If implementing your own tape on some other platform, it is important
to understand that the fields of the tape struct in this 'tape.c'
are particular to this implementation. The only fields of that
struct that belong to the logical nature of a tape are pos
(the current cell), maxPos (the length of the tape),
and arguably maybe some of the mode information.

Note on ncurses: although ncurses supports the use of mutliple windows,
they were intentionally not used to implement split-tape mode because
bare-metal implementations of the tape will not have that luxury
available (and indeed will not use ANSI terminals at all).
The lessons learned here will directly translate to
forthcoming bare-metal tape implementations.

Important: stdtrc output generally does not support UTF-8.
Only send 7-bit ASCII characters to stdtrc.

==============================================================================

  For reference: FVM 1.1 SIMPLE MULTIPLEXING

  FVM 1.1 may optionally use multiplexing to allow multiple virtual devices
  to share a single physical serial communication link. The simple multiplexing
  is that each data packet is preceded by a routing byte in which the
  most significant bit (bit 7) is always zero, the next two
  most significant bits (bits 6 and 5) identify the device type and
  the next bit (bit 4) identifies the packet size (essentially byte or word) and
  the four least significant bits (bit 3 to 0) identify the absolute value
  of the device ID (e.g. an ID of -1 is communicated as an ID of 1).
  Note that, by Freeputer convention, a device ID of 0 is only used for stdtrc
  and stdblk; an input stream never has a device ID of 0; and output streams
  have negative IDs. The crude multiplexing scheme used here only supports
  device IDs whose absolute value is between 0 and 15 inclusive.

  Most significant bits:

    0b0100 = device: output stream, packet size: 1 byte (byte)
    0b0101 = device: output stream, packet size: 4 bytes (word)
    0b0000 = device: input stream, packet size: 1 byte (byte)
    0b0001 = device: input stream, packet size: 4 bytes (word)
    0b0010 = device: block device, packet size: 5 bytes (word addr then byte)
    0b0011 = device: block device, packet size: 8 bytes (word addr then word)
    0b0110 = reserved (not used)
    0b0111 = reserved (not used) e.g. 0b01111111 unknown device
    0b1--- = reserved (not used)

  Thus byte communication uses:

    0b01000000 = stdtrc 0
    0b00000001 = stdin 1
    0b00000002 = stdimp 2
    0b00100000 = stdblk 0
    0b01000001 = stdout -1
    0b01000010 = stdexp -2
    0b0110----- = reserved (not used)

  Thus word communication uses:

    0b01010000 = stdtrc 0
    0b00010001 = stdin 1
    0b00010002 = stdimp 2
    0b00110000 = stdblk 0
    0b01010001 = stdout -1
    0b01010010 = stdexp -2
    0b0111----- = reserved (not used)

/*
  Logic to decode escape sequences generated by ncurses when
  various keys are pressed. This only handles a small subset of
  keys we happen to care about and while not particularly
  robust does the job well enough for intial experimentation
  with the tape as a user interface. In the fullness of
  time this logic could be expanded to handle more
  keys and to do more robust error handling of
  nonsensical sequences.

  Note: whether or not the recognized escape sequences here
  (which all originate from ncurses when keys are pressed)
  actually cause anything to happen is up to the server
  not the tape itself. The server may decide, for example,
  to refuse to turn off wrap mode despite the user
  having pressed Ctrl-R. The server (that is, the application
  typically running on a Freeputer instance at the other end of
  the serial device this tape talks to) decides how the
  tape shall behave; it does this by selectively and
  appropriately deciding which escape sequences it
  will and will not echo back to the tape. Indeed the
  same applies for ordinary characters; the server can choose
  to echo them back to the tape or not to do so,
  as it decides. The server is the controller.

  This handleOver function should be called when not in wrap mode and
  output has reached the end of the tape (not including the message cell
  and not including, if in split-tape mode, the second half of the
  tape which is used for stdtrc output). This handleOver function
  displays a message (by calling msgOver()) so the user knows
  overflow occurred and it also informs the server that overflow
  occurred by sending CHAR_EM to the server). The aim of this
  is to inform both the user and the server that some
  information the server wanted the user to see was
  not seen because the tape was full. What happens next is up to the
  server (it might keep sending characters anyway, knowing they
  will not be visible, or it might stop sending characters,
  or it might reposition the cursor, or command the tape to clear,
  or whatever is the appropriate behaviour for the application).

  In short: when in wrap mode, previous output is simply overwritten
  as the tape automatically would clear itself and keep displaying
  characters received (thus handleOver should never be called in wrap mode).
  That means the most recent output is always visible but earlier
  output might be overwriten. Whereas when not in wrap mode,
  earlier output is visible and more recent output is not visible
  once the tape becomes full (unless the server decides to make
  something else happen when handleOver is called and it subsequently
  receives CHAR_EM as notification). Note that EM is End of Medium.

  Character c is assumed to be from stdtrc of the FVM instance

  either logs, or (in split-tape mode only) displays, or logs and displays,
  that character, depending on whether TAPE_DEBUG and TAPE_SPLIT_TRC
  are defined. None of this will work, however, unless MULTIPLEX is also
  defined and the connected FVM instance properly supports multiplexing,
  an optional feature new in FVM 1.1. So this will not work with
  current FVM 1.0 implementations.

  Note: if you are using a pseudoterminal device (such as /dev/pts/0)
  to connect to a local FVM instance also running on Linux, you don't need
  to use any of this because the tracing output from your local
  FVM instance will be sent by it to std.trc as usual (unless,
  of course, it is itself set to MULTIPLEX mode).

  So when would you use this?

  This ttrace function (and split-tape mode in general) is mainly
  intended to be used when you are using multiplexing to connect this tape
  via a physical serial device to a remote computer or remote microcontroller
  and so you do not have direct access to the std.trc output file
  of the FVM instance running on that device. Therefore you would arrange
  for that remote FVM instance to be started up in multiplexing mode
  and then use split-tape mode (which uses this ttrace function)
  to happily view tracing output from the remote FVM.
