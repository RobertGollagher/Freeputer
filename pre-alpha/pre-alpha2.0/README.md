Freeputer ( ) \[ \] { } smaller simpler better

## Values

1. VM **simpler and easier to implement**.
2. VM **even more portable**.
3. VM **entirely correct**.
4. VM **standardized**.
5. VM **smaller**.
6. VM **faster**.

## Discussion

Although Freeputer 2.0 will not run unmodified Freeputer 1.0 programs, the fundamental design remains similar: a stack machine which is easy for human beings to understand and which favours correctness over robustness. The architecture enforces correctness by trapping. Robustness is the responsibility of the programmer and can be aided by self-virtualization of virtual machine instances.

Freeputer 2.0 will be implemented in JavaScript, which for the first time should make it easy to run Freeputer in popular web browsers available on billions of consumer devices. Furthermore, Freeputer 2.0 will continue to support targeting x86, C, Linux, and Java. There will also be new bare-metal support for targeting Arduino (ARM) and chipKIT (PIC32) boards via the Arduino IDE. So the same small Freeputer program could run on a powerful server or in a web browser or on a microcontroller. This is true software reuse.

### Proposed Design

- Stack machine with 4 stacks: data (ds), temporary (ts), return (rs), counter (cs).
- Harvard architecture ensures ease of native implementation:
    - program logic is entirely independent of instruction encoding;
    - program memory (pm) <= 2^24 *instructions* (as reported by the pmi instruction);
    - data memory (dm) <= 2^30 *words* (as reported by the dmw instruction).
- Words and stack elements are 32-bit and arithmetic is two's complement.
- Non-native implementations use fixed-width 32-bit instructions (FW32):
    - literals 1:31 (bit 31 *literal bit*, 30..0 *literal value*);
    - other 8:24 (bits 31..24 *opcode*, 23..0 *instruction number*, *metadata*, or unused).
- The VM traps to fail fast and finally. This includes:
    - arithmetic traps (from add, sub, inc, dec, mul, div, mod); and
    - all other traps as seen in FVM 1.0; but
    - without any reset capability.
- However, it is possible to achieve robustness using:
    - the catch instruction which:
        - branches if the previously executed instruction trapped;
        - otherwise functions as a no-op.
    - several convenient metadata instructions which:
        - make it easy to conditionally branch if prerequisites are not met;
        - include the pmi, dmw, dsa, dse, tsa, tse, rsa, rse, csa and cse instructions.
- The instruction set will include:
    - somewhat fewer instructions than FVM 1.0; but
    - a sufficiently large set of convenient RISC instructions; and
    - a few convenient CISC instructions such as copy; and
    - the instructions: halt, fail.
- The I/O strategy is yet to be detemined.
- The design might possibly include a ground state such as:
    - a REPL fallback after a trap ends execution; or
    - a hypervisor.
