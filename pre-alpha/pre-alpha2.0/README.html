<p>Freeputer ( ) [ ] { } smaller simpler better</p>
<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>VM <strong>simple and easy to implement</strong>.</li>
<li>VM exceedingly <strong>portable</strong>.</li>
<li>VM entirely <strong>correct</strong>.</li>
<li>VM largely <strong>robust</strong>.</li>
<li>VM <strong>standard</strong>.</li>
<li>VM <strong>small</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Freeputer 2.0 will be <strong><em>much easier to implement</em></strong>, making it even more portable. To demonstrate this, the prototype for Freeputer 2.0 is now being developed in JavaScript and HTML 5, which should make it easy to run Freeputer in popular web browsers available <strong><em>on billions of consumer devices</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Freeputer 2.0 will continue to support targeting x86, gcc, Linux, and Java. There will also be new bare-metal support for targeting Arduino (ARM) and chipKIT (PIC32) boards via the Arduino IDE.</p>
<p>Freeputer 2.0 <strong><em>adds excellent robustness</em></strong>. Whereas Freeputer 1.0 trapped (stopping the virtual machine) to preserve its excellent correctness, the design of Freeputer 2.0 is more robust in that it keeps running while maintaining excellent correctness. It achieves this by <em>branching on failure</em> rather than <em>trapping on failure</em>.</p>
<p>Freeputer 2.0 has a smaller standard address space than Freeputer 1.0. Keeping it small achieves excellent correctness and excellent robustness <em>at the same time</em>, in a manner which is portable <em>and</em> simpler and easier to implement. This is why the motto of Freeputer 2.0 is: <strong><em>smaller simpler better</em></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>Freeputer 1.0 and 2.0 are <strong><em>quite similar but not binary compatible</em></strong>. The instruction set and its bytecode has been changed somewhat. However, existing Freelang 1.0 programs could probably be modified and recompiled as Freelang 2.0 programs for Freeputer 2.0 <strong><em>without great difficulty</em></strong>.</p>

<li>The VM is <strong>correct without trapping</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Simple instructions</strong> are 1 word: an unsigned 24-bit <em>failure address</em> above an unsigned 8-bit <em>opcode</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Complex instructions</strong> also have a second word: a signed 32-bit <em>literal</em>.</li>

<li>A <em>read-only</em> cell is one which only supports the @ instruction.</li>
<li>A <em>write-only</em> cell is one which only supports the ! instruction.</li>
<li>A <em>read/write</em> cell is one which supports both the @ and ! instructions.</li>
