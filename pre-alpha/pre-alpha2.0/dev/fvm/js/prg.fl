This is an unstable Freelang program being used for iterative experimentation
in the development of the JavaScript prototype of the FVM 2.0.

It can be compiled by...

  ./mk.sh prg.fl

...to produce 'prgBase64.js' for use by 'fvmui.html'.

WARNING: This is pre-alpha software and as such may well be incomplete,
unstable and unreliable. It is considered to be suitable only for
experimentation and nothing more.

NOTES

Syntax for compiler directive which declares the current failure address
for branch on failure is simply to surround the failure address
with <> as follows. This is entirely compile-time logic:

  <:bad>          \ a back-reference to a previous label
  <1024>          \ a literal PRG cell number
  <:>              \ revert to previous failure address

The default is <0> if no failure address is ever declared. This could
potentially cause a faulty program to endlessly restart itself, so it is
wise to always declare a sensible failure address. A failure-address
declaration applies until the compiler encounters another such
declaration. This is compile-time logic not runtime logic.

All other compiler directives in future shall be surrounded by <<>> and
there is currently only one of these, namely slotFloor:

  <<slotFloor>>   \ formerly was simply slotFloor rather than <<slotFloor>>
