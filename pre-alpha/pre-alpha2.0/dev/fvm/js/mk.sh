# Instructions
# ============
#
# Run this script to make a file called 'prgBase64.js' which declares
# a JavaScript variable named prgBase64 and defines its value as a base64
# string representing a compiled Freelang program.
#
# Specify the Freelang source file to be compiled:
#
#   ./mk.sh source.fl
#
# For this to work, 'flx.rb' (or a symbolic link to it) must exist
# locally. The usual information produced by 'flx.rb' will also be produced,
# namely the files 'debug.flx' and 'map.info'.
#
# The generated 'prgBase64.js' can be used by 'fvmui.html'.
