Version:    pre-alpha-0.0.0.0+ for FVM 2.0

See 'tvm.s'. It is the primary implementation.
This 'tvm.c' is a secondard implementation in C as a sanity check.

                              This Edition:
                               Portable C 
                            for Linux and gcc

                               ( ) [ ] { }

==============================================================================
                                 BUILDING
==============================================================================

For now, since this is a pre-alpha implementation and thus performance is
a secondary consideration, the recommended command to build the FVM executable
for a Linux target with the provided Makefile is simply:

  make

Which is equivalent to:

  gcc -o fvm fvm.c

 WARNING: This is pre-alpha software and as such may well be incomplete,
 unstable and unreliable. It is considered to be suitable only for
 experimentation and nothing more.
