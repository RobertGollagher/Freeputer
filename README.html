<p>Freeputer ( ) [ ] { } forever free</p>
<h2 id="what-is-freeputer">What is Freeputer?</h2>
<p>Freeputer is a free computer. Free as in freedom.</p>
<p>Freeputer is a tiny virtual machine easily ported to most modern architectures, including bare metal, and requiring neither file system nor operating system. This offers extreme portability and the freedom to use software forever without designed obsolescence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Freeputer is a virtual machine: the Freeputer Virtual Machine (FVM).</li>
<li>Freeputer is a self-hosted, self-contained software development platform.</li>
<li>Freeputer is a platform for modular software that lasts forever.</li>
<li>Freeputer is a powerful platform for bare metal computing.</li>
<li>Freeputer is a user's computer not a vendor's computer.</li>
<li>Freeputer supports the freedom of the user.</li>
<li>Freeputer is a not an operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-can-i-learn-more">Where can I learn more?</h2>
<p>For an introduction to Freeputer, including a Quick Start tutorial, see <a href="archive/1.0/README.md">README.md</a> or <a href="archive/1.0/README.html">README.html</a>.</p>
<p>To learn Freeputer you should use the provided <a href="archive/1.0">Freeputer 1.0</a> archive (equivalent to the git tag <strong>fpv1.0.0.2</strong>) since that is the version for which the Quick Start tutorial was written. Using Freeputer 1.0 will teach you the basic principles of Freeputer and Freelang while avoiding unnecessary complexity.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-latest-news">What's the latest news?</h2>
<p>Freeputer 1.1 is coming!</p>
<p>Expected as an alpha release by mid-2016, it should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an FVM 1.1, with some additional instructions</li>
<li>continued support for running on servers and desktops</li>
<li>slightly enhanced versions of the Freelang compilers flc and flx</li>
<li>support for an extraordinarily portable textual user-interface (the 'tape')</li>
<li>very significant support for using the FVM 1.1 on Arduino and chipKIT</li>
<li>design enhancements meant to facilitate future standalone use</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above has already been successfully spiked.</p>
<h2 id="so-wheres-the-code">So where's the code?</h2>
<p>The complete Freeputer 1.0 code is in the <a href="archive/1.0" class="uri">archive/1.0</a> folder (git tag <strong>fpv1.0.0.2</strong>). The Freeputer 1.1 code isn't online yet; you will gradually see some of it start to appear in the pre-alpha folder as work proceeds.</p>
