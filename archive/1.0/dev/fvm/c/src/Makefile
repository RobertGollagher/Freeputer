# ============================================================================
#
# To make on any platform use:
# 
#   make
# 
# However, that would result in very poor performance since it uses
# no optimizations whatsoever. Therefore it is better to use one of the below.
#
# To make for best performance on 32-bit x86 use:
# 
#   make x86
# 
# To make for best performance on ARM11 (Raspberry Pi) use:
# 
#   make pi
#
# To make for reasonably good performance on any platform use:
#
#   make any
