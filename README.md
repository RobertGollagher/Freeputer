Freeputer ( ) \[ \] { } forever free

## What is Freeputer?

Freeputer is a free computer. Free as in freedom.

Freeputer is a tiny virtual machine easily ported to most modern architectures, including bare metal, and requiring neither file system nor operating system. This offers extreme portability and the freedom to use software forever without designed obsolescence.

* Freeputer is a virtual machine: the Freeputer Virtual Machine (FVM).
* Freeputer is a self-hosted, self-contained software development platform.
* Freeputer is a platform for modular software that lasts forever.
* Freeputer is a powerful platform for bare metal computing.
* Freeputer is a user's computer not a vendor's computer.
* Freeputer supports the freedom of the user.
* Freeputer is a not an operating system.

## Where can I learn more?

For an introduction to Freeputer, including a Quick Start tutorial, see [README.md](archive/1.0/README.md) or [README.html](archive/1.0/README.html).

To learn Freeputer you should use the provided [Freeputer 1.0](archive/1.0) archive (equivalent to the git tag **fpv1.0.0.2**) since that is the version for which the Quick Start tutorial was written. Using Freeputer 1.0 will teach you the basic principles of Freeputer and Freelang while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## What's the latest news?

Freeputer 1.1 is coming!

Expected as an alpha release by mid-2016, it should include:

* an FVM 1.1, with some **additional instructions**
* continued support for targeting x86 or gcc or Linux or Java
* support for **Arduino** (ARM) and **chipKIT** (PIC32) boards via the Arduino IDE
* optional support for an extraordinarily portable textual user-interface (**the tape**)
* optional standard sizings: **Freeputer Lite** and **Freeputer Heavy**
* design enhancements meant to facilitate future standalone use including  
slightly enhanced versions of the Freelang compilers flc and flx

A new standard sizing, called **Freeputer Lite** or FVM Lite, standardizes the use of Freeputer on microcontrollers and also facilitates the creation and reuse of tiny software modules of standard size on any supported platform. FVM Lite has 32 kB of FVM RAM, 32 kB of FVM ROM and stack depths of 32 elements each for data stack, software stack and return stack. This is in accordance with the Freeputer design philosophy: *modular not monolithic*. Recommended minimum hardware to conveniently run FVM Lite is 64 kB RAM and 128 kB flash. Therefore FVM Lite is convenient to use on Arduino Due and chipKIT Max32. Of course you can still easily compile very large FVM instances, up to 2 gigabytes in size, and there will also be a standard **Freeputer Heavy** or FVM Heavy sized in megabytes.

Most of the above has already been successfully spiked.

Freeputer 1.1 is fundamentally about hardware freedom. For example, it very easily allows an FVM to be deployed to an Arduino as a bare-metal, dedicated, interactive system with its own PS/2 keyboard and simple LCD display. Alternatively, it very easily allows that Arduino to be connected via serial connection to a remote 'tape terminal' with a more sophisticated display (driven by another Arduino or running on a Linux computer). Such hardware freedom is a prerequisite for true software freedom. That the same software module can easily be run on a microcontroller or on a powerful server demonstrates true freedom and protects your investment in writing that software.

## So where's the code?

The complete Freeputer 1.0 code is in the [archive/1.0](archive/1.0) folder (git tag **fpv1.0.0.2**). The Freeputer 1.1 code isn't online yet; you will gradually see some of it start to appear in the pre-alpha folder as work proceeds.
