Freeputer ( ) \[ \] { } forever free

## What is Freeputer?

Freeputer is a free computer. Free as in freedom.

Freeputer is a tiny virtual machine easily ported to most modern architectures, including bare metal, and requiring neither file system nor operating system. This offers extreme portability and the freedom to use software forever without designed obsolescence.

* Freeputer is a virtual machine: the Freeputer Virtual Machine (FVM).
* Freeputer is a self-hosted, self-contained software development platform.
* Freeputer is a platform for modular software that lasts forever.
* Freeputer is a powerful platform for bare metal computing.
* Freeputer is a user's computer not a vendor's computer.
* Freeputer supports the freedom of the user.
* Freeputer is a not an operating system.

## Where can I learn more?

For an introduction to Freeputer, including a Quick Start tutorial, see [README.md](archive/1.0/README.md) or [README.html](archive/1.0/README.html).

To learn Freeputer you should use the provided [Freeputer 1.0](archive/1.0) archive (equivalent to the git tag **fpv1.0.0.2**) since that is the version for which the Quick Start tutorial was written. Using Freeputer 1.0 will teach you the basic principles of Freeputer and Freelang while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## What's the latest news?

Freeputer 1.1 is coming!

Expected as an alpha release by mid-2016, it should include:

* an FVM 1.1, with **additional instructions**
* continued support for targeting **x86** or **gcc** or **Linux** or **Java**
* new optional support for **Arduino** (ARM) and **chipKIT** (PIC32) boards via the Arduino IDE
* new optional support for an extraordinarily portable textual user-interface (**the tape**)
* new optional standard FVM sizings: **Freeputer Lite** and **Freeputer Heavy**  
both with **greater stack depth: 256 elements** instead of 32 elements
* stand-alone Freeputer Lite with PS/2 keyboard and LCD display
* updated Freelang compilers (flc and flx) and decompiler (fld)
* appropriately updated fvmtest test suite

Most of the above has already been successfully spiked.

**Freeputer Lite** (aka **FVM Lite**) will standardize the size of small Freeputer 1.1 instances, facilitating the virtualization and reuse of small software modules of standard size. FVM Lite will have 16&nbsp;KiB of FVM RAM, 16&nbsp;KiB of FVM ROM and stack depths of 256 elements each for data stack, software stack and return stack. This is in accordance with the Freeputer design philosophy: *modular not monolithic*. Comfortable hardware minimums are 32&nbsp;KiB RAM and 128&nbsp;KiB flash; at least 64&nbsp;KiB RAM is preferred for FVM virtualization entirely in RAM. Arduino Due and chipKIT Max32 are therefore good choices. Large applications will in future be *composed* of FVM Lite instances.

**Freeputer Heavy** (aka **FVM Heavy**) will standardize the size of large Freeputer 1.1 instances. FVM Heavy will have 16&nbsp;MiB of FVM RAM, 16&nbsp;MiB of FVM ROM and stack depths of 256 elements each for data stack, software stack and return stack. However, it is recommended that FVM Heavy should only be used when neither a single FVM Lite instance nor a cluster of FVM Lite instances could reasonably be used.

Freeputer 1.1 is fundamentally about **greater hardware freedom.** That the same small software module can easily be run on a microcontroller or on a powerful server demonstrates true freedom and protects your investment in writing that software.

## So where's the code?

The complete Freeputer 1.0 code is in the [archive/1.0](archive/1.0) folder (git tag **fpv1.0.0.2**). The Freeputer 1.1 code isn't online yet; you will gradually see some of it start to appear in the pre-alpha folder as work proceeds.
