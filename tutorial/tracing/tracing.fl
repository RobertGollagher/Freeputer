  \ You must deploy this program to an FVM whose RAM starts at 16777216
  \ Note: use the ready-made fvm16-16MB executable

  slotFloor 16777216 \ Direct the compiler to put lowest slot at 16777216
  mySlot# 4          \ Declare a slot of size 4 bytes (1 word)


  tron          \ (         ) Turn on tracing (note: DS is empty)
  3 #mySlot !   \ (         ) Store the value 3 into that slot
  oneTwoThree   \ ( 1 2 3   ) Call oneTwoThree, it will put 1 2 3 on DS
  3             \ ( 1 2 3 3 ) Put another 3 on the DS
  go== :noFour  \ ( 1 2     ) Branch to label noFour: if top 2 elements equal

    \ We will never hit the next line because the top 2 elements were
    \   indeed equal so go== will have branched to the label noFour: below
    4           \ ( 1 2 4 ) Would put 4 on DS if we hit this line
    halt        \ ( 1 2 4 ) Would halt with 1 2 4 on DS if we hit this line

  noFour:       \ ( 1 2   )
    drop2       \ (       ) Discard the top two elements of DS
    troff       \ (       ) Turn off tracing (note: DS is empty)
    halt        \ (       ) Halt the FVM

  \ Put 1 2 3 on the DS
  : oneTwoThree \ ( -- 1 2 3 ) This is a word definition
    1 2         \ ( 1 2   ) Put 1 and 2 on the DS
    ##mySlot @  \ ( 1 2 3 ) Load the value stored in mySlot (namely 3)
  ;             \ ( 1 2 3 ) Return (compiler inserts ret where ; is located)
